#Getting Started
The mPOS EMV SDK is available to clients who register through the [Ingenico Developer Portal](http://developer.ingenico.us). Once necessary credentials have been obtained for the portal, navigate to the Software tab on the banner and download the SDK package.

## Developer Portal
The Ingenico Developer Portal serves as a distribution channel for our mPOS SDK material, as well as a collaborative environment for third-party developers to get the support they need for their projects and applications. 

<br/>A request for an account can be made at http://developer.ingenico.us and will be reviewed by the internal Ingenico team before the account is activated. (Note: This allows creation of a user account only, therefore each user (developer) for an ISV will need to register and create their own account.)

<br/>Once approved, an NDA will be executed and a new client/customer record will be created in the portal for future portal notifications, updates, and any other changes.

<br/>Existing clients who utilize the ROAMpay API (or are clients for RUA or another API product through Netsuite) will be asked to register on the developer portal in order to access the new mPOS EMV SDK.


##JavaDoc Resource
The SDK comes with an included Javadoc resource which contains information regarding all API classes, methods, exceptions, and other definitions. The Javadoc can be found in the **\libs** folder of the SDK package that was downloaded. 

The filename for the Javadoc resource is as follows: **ingenico-mpos-sdk- v1.X.X-javadoc.jar**. 

In order to properly open the Javadoc, please extract all contents within the jar file into a separate folder and locate the **index.html** file.
